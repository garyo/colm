I got sick of the fact that ls(1) will sort its columns down when given
no arguments, but not in any other case.  And I figured the world needed
a decent columnation tool.  So here is one I just whipped up; it does
fixed and variable width columns, selectable gutter widths, it automatically
figures out how many columns to use (unlike pr -#), and it allows various
formatting options such as selectable leader character, selectable tabbing
with selectable tab size, and your choice of leaders or a separation string.
Colm should compile on any machine that has getopt(3C).
